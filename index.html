People choose to commit crimes, and that's why they are locked up or locked out, we are told. This feature makes the politics of responsibility particularly tempting, as it appears the system can be avoided with good behavior. But herein lies the trap. All people make mistakes. All of us are sinners. All of us are criminals. All of us violate the law at some point in our lives. In fact, if the worst thing you have ever done is speed ten miles over the speed limit on the freeway, you have put yourself and others at more risk of harm than someone smoking marijuana in the privacy of his or her living room. Yet there are people in the United States serving life sentences for first-time drug offenses, something virtually unheard of anywhere else in the world.” -->

There are millions of African-Americans now cycling in and out of prisons and jails or under correctional control. In major American cities today, more than half of working-age African-American men are either under correctional control or branded felons and are thus subject to legalized discrimination for the rest of their lives.-->

                        “It is our civic duty to continue to push as hard as we can for real change, not politics as usual. Our lives depend on it.” “Democracy is increasingly hard to define, especially in today’s political context. Not everyone agrees on what democracy is but one thing we do know is that democracy has always excluded black people.” “How do we live in a world that dehumanizes us and still be human? The fight is not just being able to keep breathing. The fight is actually to be able to walk down the street with your head held high—and feel like I belong here, or I deserve to be here, or I just have right to have a level of dignity.”

                        “It’s precisely the people who are considered the least ‘likely’ leaders who end up inspiring others the most. Everyday people and everyday acts of courage eventually change everything.” “There are few greater gifts than being cared for by another person. Care roots us in the interconnectedness of humanity. When we face the uncertainty of life, we have each other to rely on. But our society does not respect, protect, or value the work of caring.” “As a society, we tend to view aging as a crisis, as a loss of vitality. But I think that people getting older is not a crisis; it’s a blessing. It’s a chance to live longer, connect longer, teach longer, and love longer. There are so many ways our elders can lead vibrant lives and continue to make meaningful contributions to society even after they have retired.”

                        “There is this aimless conversation about rape in India and somehow Indian men are just more sexist and patriarchal, and it’s not about individual cases and individual localities and perpetrators that are out of control.

                        “Violent acts against Dalit women are public, performative acts of violence meant to shame women, and silence and terrorize communities. It makes a severe statement that these are the consequences of crossing caste apartheid lines, and it’s abetted by a pipeline of impunity by the Indian government. If the government were to start talking about this problem and bringing these perpetrators to justice, they would have to acknowledge how much of this violence contributes to maintaining the caste system in India.”
                        “While many South Asian communities have solidarity with black peoples, there’s also a core strain of anti-black racism within South Asian identity that is rooted in caste privilege. Many of the prejudices South Asians have towards black people are rooted in the ways they have been taught to think about darker peoples in the subcontinent.”
                        “Many of the South Asians who were privileged to migrate [to the U.S.] have privileges related to language, class and, most importantly, to caste. So when the diaspora is said to be “casteless,” or South Asians want to say that caste doesn't exist here, it basically erases the vocabulary we have to talk about the hierarchical privileges we occupy... As a larger South Asian movement we need to recognize that it is unacceptable for us to move forward until we look very deeply at the way caste privilege has shaped [our] strategies and institutions.”

                        “It’s a fair argument that Asian Americans earn more than other minorities, but what we lose in that conversation is that what privilege we have does not negate the discrimination we also face in the workplace. The notion that privilege and oppression are mutually exclusive is a way of denying the Asian American experience of discrimination, and a means of saying that we’re too privileged to have disadvantages.”

They're gonna make assumptions about all these other people that my face represents. And if I can be more human to myself and I can express that, I'd be so happy if other people also thought that Asian Americans as a category were more human or women who were funny and loud and opinionated were more human.”
There are more and more wealthy Chinese from China attending colleges and living in the United States. They are also the ones who get more attention by the media. But what still gets left out are those who have less money and political power, often times more working-class immigrants and undocumented folks. For too long Asians in America have been represented by those who are wealthier and educated.
