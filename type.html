                                Angela Davis is an American political activist, academic, and author. She emerged as a prominent counterculture activist and radical in the 1960s as a leader of the Communist Party USA, and had close relations with the Black Panther Party through her involvement in the Civil Rights Movement. She was a professor (now retired) at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in its History of Consciousness Department and a former director of the university's Feminist Studies department. Her research interests are feminism, African-American studies, critical theory, Marxism, popular music, social consciousness, and the philosophy and history of punishment and prisons. She co-founded Critical Resistance, an organization working to abolish the prison-industrial complex.

People choose to commit crimes, and that's why they are locked up or locked out, we are told. This feature makes the politics of responsibility particularly tempting, as it appears the system can be avoided with good behavior. But herein lies the trap. All people make mistakes. All of us are sinners. All of us are criminals. All of us violate the law at some point in our lives. In fact, if the worst thing you have ever done is speed ten miles over the speed limit on the freeway, you have put yourself and others at more risk of harm than someone smoking marijuana in the privacy of his or her living room. Yet there are people in the United States serving life sentences for first-time drug offenses, something virtually unheard of anywhere else in the world.”-->

There are millions of African-Americans now cycling in and out of prisons and jails or under correctional control. In major American cities today, more than half of working-age African-American men are either under correctional control or branded felons and are thus subject to legalized discrimination for the rest of their lives.-->

It is a reflection as opposed to an interpretation, and I think we get a lot of interpretations about the lives of women that are not coming from women.”

                                Grace Lee Boggs was an American author, social activist, philosopher and feminist. Influenced by the German philosophers Kant and especially Hegel, a precursor of Marx, she resolved to devote her life to change in a nation of inequalities and discrimination against minorities and women. She is known for her years of political collaboration with C. L. R. James and Raya Dunayevskaya in the 1940s and 1950s. She eventually went off in her own political direction, identifying closely with the Black Power Movement.

                        “Violent acts against Dalit women are public, performative acts of violence meant to shame women, and silence and terrorize communities. It makes a severe statement that these are the consequences of crossing caste apartheid lines, and it’s abetted by a pipeline of impunity by the Indian government. If the government were to start talking about this problem and bringing these perpetrators to justice, they would have to acknowledge how much of this violence contributes to maintaining the caste system in India.”
                        “While many South Asian communities have solidarity with black peoples, there’s also a core strain of anti-black racism within South Asian identity that is rooted in caste privilege. Many of the prejudices South Asians have towards black people are rooted in the ways they have been taught to think about darker peoples in the subcontinent.”
                        “Many of the South Asians who were privileged to migrate [to the U.S.] have privileges related to language, class and, most importantly, to caste. So when the diaspora is said to be “casteless,” or South Asians want to say that caste doesn't exist here, it basically erases the vocabulary we have to talk about the hierarchical privileges we occupy... As a larger South Asian movement we need to recognize that it is unacceptable for us to move forward until we look very deeply at the way caste privilege has shaped [our] strategies and institutions.”

There are more and more wealthy Chinese from China attending colleges and living in the United States. They are also the ones who get more attention by the media. But what still gets left out are those who have less money and political power, often times more working-class immigrants and undocumented folks. For too long Asians in America have been represented by those who are wealthier and educated.
