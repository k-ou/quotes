                                Angela Davis is an American political activist, academic, and author. She emerged as a prominent counterculture activist and radical in the 1960s as a leader of the Communist Party USA, and had close relations with the Black Panther Party through her involvement in the Civil Rights Movement. She was a professor (now retired) at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in its History of Consciousness Department and a former director of the university's Feminist Studies department. Her research interests are feminism, African-American studies, critical theory, Marxism, popular music, social consciousness, and the philosophy and history of punishment and prisons. She co-founded Critical Resistance, an organization working to abolish the prison-industrial complex.

People choose to commit crimes, and that's why they are locked up or locked out, we are told. This feature makes the politics of responsibility particularly tempting, as it appears the system can be avoided with good behavior. But herein lies the trap. All people make mistakes. All of us are sinners. All of us are criminals. All of us violate the law at some point in our lives. In fact, if the worst thing you have ever done is speed ten miles over the speed limit on the freeway, you have put yourself and others at more risk of harm than someone smoking marijuana in the privacy of his or her living room.

In major American cities today, more than half of working-age African-American men are either under correctional control or branded felons and are thus subject to legalized discrimination for the rest of their lives.-->

                        “It’s a fair argument that Asian Americans earn more than other minorities, but what we lose in that conversation is that what privilege we have does not negate the discrimination we also face in the workplace. The notion that privilege and oppression are mutually exclusive is a way of denying the Asian American experience of discrimination, and a means of saying that we’re too privileged to have disadvantages.”

                        “[Comedy] makes me more human. And as an Asian American woman, this is my body, this is what I look like, people read me as this person. They're gonna make assumptions about all these other people that my face represents. And if I can be more human to myself and I can express that, I'd be so happy if other people also thought that Asian Americans as a category were more human or women who were funny and loud and opinionated were more human.”
There are more and more wealthy Chinese from China attending colleges and living in the United States. They are also the ones who get more attention by the media. But what still gets left out are those who have less money and political power, often times more working-class immigrants and undocumented folks. For too long Asians in America have been represented by those who are wealthier and educated.
